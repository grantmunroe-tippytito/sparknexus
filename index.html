NAVIGATION EXPLANATION:
The navigation bar uses CSS to create an interactive menu:
- Links change color on :hover (when you move mouse over them)
- The current page has class="active" for highlighting
- position: sticky keeps nav at top when scrolling
- All done with CSS - no JavaScript needed!

The same navigation appears on all 4 pages, but the "active" 
class moves to whichever page you're currently viewing.
