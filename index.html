                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a journeyman motorcycle technician with a passion for engines, mechanics, and the open road. My journey started in Toronto, where I grew up learning the ins and outs of what makes things tick.</p>
                
                <h3>My Educational Path</h3>
                <p>My technical education took me across Canada:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Central Tech High School</strong> - Toronto, where it all began</li>
                    <li><strong>Canadore College</strong> - Eco-tourism Certificate</li>
                    <li><strong>Grande Prairie Regional College</strong> - Harley-Davidson factory training and Journeyman Certification</li>
                    <li><strong>Red Deer Polytechnic</strong> - Completing Network Administration Diploma</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Each institution helped shape me into the technician I am today, and I'm grateful for the diverse experiences and knowledge I gained along the way.</p>

                <h2>Meet Tippy</h2>
                <div class="dog-info">
                    <p>No introduction would be complete without mentioning my four-legged companion, <strong>Tippy</strong>. Whether I'm working in the garage or taking a break, Tippy is always nearby, bringing joy and companionship to every day.</p>
                    
                    <p>There's something special about the bond between a technician and their dog - Tippy knows when it's time to work and when it's time to play. A true shop dog at heart!</p>

                <h2>My Passion</h2>
                <p>Working on motorcycles isn't just a job - it's a calling. There's nothing quite like diagnosing a problem, getting your hands dirty, and bringing a machine back to life. Every bike has its own personality, and every repair is a new puzzle to solve.</p>
                <p>Network the world! I am excited to begin my new career in IT</p>
                <p>From Toronto to the prairies and beyond, the journey continues - one motorcycle at a time.</p>
